### 2. Learning System (`learning-system.py`)

Python-based AI learning and recommendation engine.

```bash
# Collect usage data
python3 scripts/ai/learning-system.py collect

# Generate recommendations
python3 scripts/ai/learning-system.py recommend

# Provide feedback for learning
python3 scripts/ai/learning-system.py feedback --feedback-action "theme_switch" --feedback-value "positive"
```

### 3. AI Scheduler (`ai-scheduler.sh`)

Background automation and monitoring system.

```bash
# Install as systemd service
./scripts/ai/ai-scheduler.sh setup

# Check system status
./scripts/ai/ai-scheduler.sh status

# Manual optimization trigger
./scripts/ai/ai-scheduler.sh optimize

# Control scheduler
./scripts/ai/ai-scheduler.sh stop
./scripts/ai/ai-scheduler.sh restart
```

## Architecture

### Data Collection
The system continuously collects:
- **System Metrics**: CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage, load average
- **Application Usage**: Running applications and their resource consumption
- **Usage Patterns**: Time-based usage patterns by day of week and hour
- **User Feedback**: Positive/negative feedback on AI actions

### Machine Learning
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies recurring usage patterns
- **Workload Classification**: Categorizes sessions into workload types
- **Recommendation Engine**: Generates intelligent suggestions based on collected data
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides confidence levels for recommendations
- **Feedback Integration**: Learns from user preferences over time

### Automation Levels
1. **Manual**: Run individual AI functions as needed
2. **Semi-automatic**: Receive recommendations and apply manually
3. **Fully Automatic**: Background scheduler runs optimizations automatically

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6+ with `psutil` module
- Bash shell
- systemd (for background automation)
- notify-send (for notifications)

### Quick Start
```bash
# Install Python dependencies
pip3 install --user psutil

# Make scripts executable
chmod +x scripts/ai/*.sh scripts/ai/*.py

# Test the system
./scripts/ai/demo.sh

# For production use
./scripts/ai/ai-scheduler.sh setup
```

## Usage Examples

### Daily Usage
```bash
# Morning routine - optimize for the day
./scripts/ai/ai-enhancements.sh all

# Check AI recommendations
python3 scripts/ai/learning-system.py recommend

# Apply theme for current workload
./scripts/ai/ai-enhancements.sh theme
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
# The AI automatically detects code editors (VS Code, Vim, etc.)
# and applies development-optimized settings:
# - BFQ I/O scheduler for better interactivity
# - Ondemand CPU governor for balanced performance
# - Development-friendly themes (monokai-pro, etc.)
```

### Gaming Session
```bash
# The AI detects gaming applications (Steam, Lutris, etc.)
# and automatically applies:
# - Performance CPU governor
# - mq-deadline I/O scheduler for low latency
# - Dark themes to reduce eye strain
# - Closes unnecessary background processes
```

## Configuration Files

python3 scripts/ai/learning-system.py collect

# Check data collection
cat ~/.config/hypr/ai-enhancements/learning_data.json
```

**Notifications not working**
```bash
# Test notification system
notify-send "Test" "Notification working"

# Check if notify-send is installed
which notify-send
```

### Debug Mode
Enable debug output by setting environment variable:
```bash
export AI_DEBUG=1
./scripts/ai/ai-enhancements.sh all
```

### Reset Learning Data
```bash
# Clear all learning data
rm -f ~/.config/hypr/ai-enhancements/learning_data.json
rm -f ~/.config/hypr/ai-enhancements/recommendations.json

# Start fresh
python3 scripts/ai/learning-system.py collect
```

## Performance Impact

The AI system is designed to be lightweight:
- **Data Collection**: ~1% CPU usage for 5 seconds every 5 minutes
