   hypr-ai-start
   ```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Check system status
./cli.py status --detailed

## üîß Configuration

The system uses a JSON configuration file located at `config/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "ai_optimizer": {
    "enabled": true,
    "optimization_interval": 30,
    "learning_rate": 0.001,
    "conservative_mode": false
  },
  "adaptive_config": {
    "enabled": true,
    "learning_interval": 60,
    "confidence_threshold": 0.7,
    "min_samples": 10
  },
  "self_healing": {
    "enabled": true,
    "monitoring_interval": 30,
    "auto_fix_enabled": true,
    "max_fix_attempts": 3
  }
}
```

### Configuration Options

## üìà How It Works

### 1. AI Performance Optimization

The AI optimizer uses a neural network to predict the best Hyprland configuration based on:
- Current system metrics (CPU, GPU, memory usage)
- Active applications and workload type
- Time of day and usage patterns
- Historical performance data

**Optimizations include:**
- Animation settings (enable/disable, speed, bezier curves)
- Blur effects and visual enhancements
- Window gaps and decorations
- VSync and refresh rate settings
- GPU acceleration preferences

### 2. Adaptive Learning

The adaptive configuration manager learns your preferences by:
- Monitoring manual configuration changes you make
- Correlating changes with system context (time, apps, workload)
- Building user preference profiles using machine learning
- Automatically applying similar changes in similar contexts

**Learning examples:**
- You disable animations when gaming ‚Üí System learns to disable animations when games are detected
- You increase blur during media consumption ‚Üí System learns your visual preferences for different activities
- You adjust gaps based on window count ‚Üí System learns your layout preferences

### 3. Self-Healing Capabilities

The self-healing system monitors for issues and can automatically:

**Performance Issues:**
- High CPU usage ‚Üí Reduce visual effects, kill resource hogs
- High memory usage ‚Üí Clear caches, enable compressed swap
- GPU overload ‚Üí Reduce effects, lower refresh rates

**Stability Issues:**
- Compositor hangs ‚Üí Restart services, reset configurations
- Application crashes ‚Üí Clean up resources, restart components

**System Issues:**
- High temperatures ‚Üí Emergency performance reduction
- Low battery ‚Üí Power saving mode activation
- Audio problems ‚Üí Restart audio services

### 4. Integration & Coordination

The main orchestrator coordinates all three systems:
- Prevents conflicting actions between systems
- Shares context and learning data between components
- Handles critical issues that require orchestrator intervention
- Provides unified monitoring and reporting

- **Transparent Operations**: All actions logged for transparency and debugging

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**System won't start:**
1. Check prerequisites: `./cli.py health`
2. Verify Hyprland is running: `hyprctl version`
3. Check Python environment: `ls -la venv/`
4. Review logs: `./cli.py logs`

**High resource usage:**
1. Enable conservative mode in configuration
2. Increase optimization intervals
3. Disable learning temporarily
4. Check for resource-intensive applications

**Incorrect optimizations:**
1. Review and adjust configuration thresholds
2. Clear learning data to retrain: `rm -rf adaptive_data/ models/`
3. Manually override problematic optimizations
4. Report issues for system improvement

### Getting Help

1. **Check logs first**: `./cli.py logs --follow`
2. **Run health check**: `./cli.py health`
3. **Generate system report**: `./cli.py report --output debug_report.json`
4. **Review configuration**: `./cli.py config show`

### Reset and Recovery

```bash
# Stop system
./cli.py stop

# Reset learning data (keeps configuration)
rm -rf adaptive_data/ models/ healing_data/

# Reset everything (nuclear option)
python3 install.py --uninstall
python3 install.py
```

## üß∞ Advanced Usage

### Custom Optimization Profiles

You can create custom optimization profiles by modifying the configuration:

```bash
./cli.py config set ai_optimizer.gaming_mode true
./cli.py config set adaptive_config.profile_switching_enabled true
```

### API Integration

The system provides internal APIs for advanced users:

```python
from core import AIOptimizer, AdaptiveConfigManager

# Initialize components
optimizer = AIOptimizer()
adaptive = AdaptiveConfigManager()

# Get current status
status = await optimizer.get_optimization_report()
```

### Custom Healing Strategies

Add custom healing strategies by extending the self-healing system:

```python
# Example: Custom GPU monitoring
async def custom_gpu_check(issue):
    # Your custom logic here
    return True

# Register custom strategy
healing_system.add_custom_strategy("gpu_custom", custom_gpu_check)
```
